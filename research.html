    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>
      I have developed a keen interest in continuous-time stochastic processes,
      with a specific focus on parameter estimation. My current research revolves
      around likelihood estimation for a state space process, where the behavior
      mimics various Brownian motions based on different underlying states. 
      This work is submitted and is currently under review.

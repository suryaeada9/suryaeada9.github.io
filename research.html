    <h3>Research Interests</h3>
    <p>
      Have been interested in continuous time stochastic processes,
      in particular parameter estimation. Current work entails
      likelihood estimation for a state space process that behaves as
      different Brownian motions according to underlying states. Work
      under review.

Telegrapher's Process: Estimation and Applications to Finance</li>
      <li>Meixner Brownian Moving Resting Process to Model Animal Movement</li>
